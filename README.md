# Behavioral Influence & Relationship Dynamics Scale (BIRDS)

## Overview

The **Behavioral Influence & Relationship Dynamics Scale (BIRDS)** is a structured framework designed to analyze and understand the complexities of social relationships, influence, and interpersonal control. This project was created to make sense of social dynamics and relationships in my own life.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to offer a practical model for understanding:

- How relationships develop and change over time
- The varying degrees of influence one can have over another
- The factors that contribute to emotional and psychological dependence
- Ways to identify and navigate different levels of social interactions

## Why This Matters

Understanding these levels can help individuals:

- **Build stronger, healthier relationships** by recognizing where they and others stand.
- **Identify unhealthy dependencies** before they become harmful.
- **Enhance social skills** by understanding how influence works in different relationships.
- **Navigate personal and professional interactions** with greater awareness and strategy.

## How to Use This Project

1. **Assess Your Relationships** – Identify where your relationships fit within the BIRDS model.
2. **Track Influence Changes** – Monitor shifts in influence over time to understand social dynamics.
3. **Improve Interactions** – Use the framework to strengthen meaningful connections and set boundaries when needed.
4. **Contribute** – If you have insights or refinements to the model, feel free to collaborate!

## Future Plans

- Create interactive tools, guides, and case studies to apply BIRDS in real-life scenarios.

## Contributing

- If you find this project interesting or useful, feel free to contribute! You can share insights, refine the model, or open discussions on the repository.
